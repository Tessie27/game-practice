# 🔥 Fire Emoji Rain

A beautiful and interactive Next.js application that creates a stunning fire emoji rain effect. Move your mouse around the screen and watch as the fiery emojis gracefully dance around your cursor!

## ✨ Features

- **🔥 Dynamic Fire Rain**: Continuous stream of falling fire emojis with realistic animation
- **🎯 Interactive Mouse Avoidance**: Emojis smoothly move around your cursor in real-time
- **⚡ Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering with requestAnimationFrame and optimized collision detection
- **🎨 Smooth Animations**: Natural falling motion with horizontal drift and fade effects
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on all screen sizes
- **♿ Accessible**: Respects reduced motion preferences

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.8 or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd fire-emoji-rain
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the magic!

## 🛠️ Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

## 🎮 How to Use

1. **Watch the Rain**: Simply open the page and enjoy the mesmerizing fire emoji rain
2. **Interact**: Move your mouse around the screen - the emojis will elegantly avoid your cursor

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 14** - React framework with built-in optimization
- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks
- **Styled JSX** - Component-scoped CSS

### Key Features Implementation
- **Collision Avoidance**: Vector-based physics for smooth emoji movement
- **Performance**: requestAnimationFrame for 60fps updates
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of completed animations

### Customization Options

You can easily customize the experience by modifying these variables in `pages/index.js`:

```javascript
const fireEmoji = '🔥';        // Change the emoji
const fallSpeed = 8;           // Adjust falling speed
const numEmojis = 3-10;        // Control density
```

## 🌟 Performance Notes

- Uses `will-change: transform` for hardware acceleration
- Implements efficient collision detection with Set data structures
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks
